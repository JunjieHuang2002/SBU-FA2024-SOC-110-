                            In the last century, fires in British Colombia were 
                            infrequent and of low severity, occurring on average 
                            once every 10-30 years and were mainly of low- to moderate-severity

                                        The first nations (Indigenous) saw fire as

                                        for biodiversity and cultural continuity. 
                                        They also viewed fire positively but used it for different objectives, 
                                        such as land clearing and agriculture.

                                        Timber is an important source of income in British Colombia. 
                                        In 1912 the government published the 
                                        <b>Forest Act</b> 
                                        that controls fires through prevention and suppression. <br>
                                        The Forest Act prohibits "<i>wilfully set fire</i>". 
                                        These particularly impact Indigenous peoples, who attempt to 
                                        continue fire prevention efforts but are forced to conform to settler worldviews and goals.

                                        There was a growing recognition that fire played an important 
                                        ecological role in many of ecosystems. Fire began to be viewed 
                                        as a natural event integral to ecosystem sustainability, rather 
                                        than solely as a destructive force.<br>
                                        In this eras, the government reintroduced and mimicked natural 
                                        fires but still focus on their <b>fire control</b> goals.

                            Through the history of fire management of British Columbia, 
                            we can analyze some reasons why severity of wildfire became higher:

                                    Indigenous peoples in British Columbia have practiced 
                                    cultural burning for thousands of years to manage landscapes 
                                    and ecosystems. Colonial policies and fire suppression strategies 
                                    interrupted these traditional practices, causing fuels to accumulate 
                                    and forest resilience to decline.

                                    has led to the accumulation of undergrowth and dense trees in forests. 
                                    This excess fuel has created conditions for wildfires.

                                    destructive fires and focused solely on suppression.

                                        British Columbia's complex topography, especially

                                        These areas receive less raining, resulting in a dry climate 
                                        that is more prone to fires.

                                        Most wildfires in B.C. are started by lightning strikes. 
                                        When lightning strikes an object it can release enough heat to ignite a tree or other fuels.

                        <h4>2023 Canadian wildfires</h4>
                        <p>
                            Beginning in March 2023, and with increased intensity starting in June, 
                            Canada was affected by a record-setting series of wildfires. 
                            All 13 provinces and territories were affected, with large fires in Alberta, 
                            British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec. 
                            The 2023 wildfire season had the most area burned in Canada's recorded history, 
                            surpassing the 1989, 1995, and 2014 fire seasons, as well as in recorded 
                            North American history, surpassing the 2020 Western US wildfire season

                            The 2023 Canadian wildfires have shown that wildfires are not just a local issue, 
                            but a global one. The impacts of these fires have been felt across the world, 
                            with smoke and air pollution spreading to other countries. 
                            To prevent future wildfires and their impacts, we need to take action now.
