                        <p>
                            In the last century, fires in British Colombia were 
                            infrequent and of low severity, occurring on average 
                            once every 10-30 years and were mainly of low- to moderate-severity
                            <sup><a href="#eight">1</a></sup>.
                            However, it has experienced its four most severe wildfire seasons 
                            (2017, 2018, 2021, and 2023) of the last half-century during the past 7 years, 
                            all of which were marked by weather extremes
                            <sup><a href="#eight">2</a></sup>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            British Columbia's frequent wildfires have become a pressing environmental and 
                            public safety concern in recent years. These devastating events, fueled by a 
                            combination of climate change, natural factors, and human activities, 
                            have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the province's borders. 
                            The wildfires not only threaten local ecosystems and communities but also impact 
                            air quality and economies in neighboring regions, including parts of the 
                            United States. As the frequency and intensity of these fires continue to escalate, 
                            there is an urgent need for comprehensive strategies to control their spread and 
                            prevent future occurrences. This topic explores the root causes of British 
                            Columbia's wildfires, their wide-ranging impacts, and the evolving approaches to 
                            fire management and prevention.

                                        The first nations (Indigenous) saw fire as

                                        They also viewed fire positively but used it for different objectives, 
                                        such as land clearing and agriculture.

                                        Timber is an important source of income in British Colombia. 
                                        In 1912 the government published the 
                                        <b>Forest Act</b> 
                                        that controls fires through prevention and suppression. <br>
                                        The Forest Act prohibits "<i>wilfully set fire</i>". 
                                        These particularly impact Indigenous peoples, who attempt to 
                                        continue fire prevention efforts but are forced to conform to settler worldviews and goals.

                                        There was a growing recognition that fire played an important 
                                        ecological role in many of ecosystems. Fire began to be viewed 
                                        as a natural event integral to ecosystem sustainability, rather 
                                        than solely as a destructive force.<br>
                                        In this eras, the government reintroduced and mimicked natural 
                                        fires but still focus on their <b>fire control</b> goals.

                                    Prior to the formalization of colonial authority over fire in the 1912 BC Forest Act, 
                                    First Nations actors harnessed fire under their own systems of governance for a variety 
                                    of cultural, spiritual, and ecological objectives Colonial policies and fire 
                                    suppression strategies interrupted these traditional practices, 
                                    causing fuels to accumulate and forest resilience to decline.

                                    coupled with decades of fire suppression policies, 
                                    has led to the accumulation of undergrowth and dense trees in forests. 
                                    This excess fuel has created conditions for wildfires.

                                    Early fire management policies considered all fires as 
                                    destructive fires and focused solely on suppression.

                        <p>
                            Beginning in March 2023, and with increased intensity starting in June, 
                            Canada was affected by a record-setting series of wildfires. 
                            All 13 provinces and territories were affected, with large fires in Alberta, 
                            British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec. 
                            The 2023 wildfire season had the most area burned in Canada's recorded history, 
                            surpassing the 1989, 1995, and 2014 fire seasons, as well as in recorded 
                            North American history, surpassing the 2020 Western US wildfire season

                                The 2023 wildfires have underscored the urgent need to adapt fire management 
                                strategies to a changing climate.
                            </b>
                            Scientists have found that climate change more 
                            than doubled the likelihood of extreme fire weather conditions in some regions of Canada. 
                            Future strategies must account for the increasing flammability of fuel due to drier 
                            conditions caused by climate change. Supporting cultural burning practices led by 
                            Indigenous communities can help reduce the risk of out-of-control wildfires.

                                The 2023 wildfire season has emphasized the need for improved technological tools in 
                                fire management. 
                            </b>
                            The Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) remains a 
                            crucial tool, but there's likely to be increased investment in enhancing its 
                            capabilities. The newly launched Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative is set to fund 
                            activities transforming how Canada manages wildland fire.

                                The scale of the 2023 wildfires has reinforced the importance of international 
                                cooperation in fire management.

                            The CIFFC's role in facilitating the exchange of resources between international 
                            partners is likely to be strengthened. There's an increased recognition that no single 
                            government or organization can tackle the challenge of wildfires alone.

                            The 2023 Canadian wildfires have shown that wildfires are not just a local issue, 
                            but a global one. The impacts of these fires have been felt across the world, 
                            with smoke and air pollution spreading to other countries. 
                            To prevent future wildfires and their impacts, we need to take action now.
